Sure, here's a sample README file for a Go language tutorial on Github:

# Go Language Tutorial

Welcome to the Go Language Tutorial! This tutorial is designed to introduce you to the Go programming language, also known as Golang. Go is a modern, open-source language developed by Google that is designed to be efficient, reliable, and easy to use.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, you should have some basic knowledge of programming concepts such as variables, functions, and control flow. You should also have some experience with a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing code.

In addition, you will need to have Go installed on your computer. You can download and install the latest version of Go from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/

## Getting Started

To get started with this tutorial, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-tutorial.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can navigate to the `src` directory and start exploring the tutorial code. The code is organized into several subdirectories, each of which covers a different aspect of the Go language:

- `basics`: Covers the basics of the Go language, including variables, functions, and control flow.
- `packages`: Covers how to use packages in Go to organize and reuse code.
- `concurrency`: Covers how to write concurrent programs in Go using goroutines and channels.
- `web`: Covers how to build web applications in Go using the built-in `net/http` package and popular third-party packages like `gorilla/mux`.

Each subdirectory contains a `README.md` file that provides a brief overview of the topics covered in that section and links to the relevant code files.

## Contributing

If you find a bug in the tutorial code or would like to suggest an improvement, feel free to open an issue or pull request on this repository. We welcome contributions from the Go community!
